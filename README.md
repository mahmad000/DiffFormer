# Hyperspectral datasets

# Several public hyperspectral datasets are available on the [EHU](https://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes), and [WHU](https://rsidea.whu.edu.cn/resource_WHUHi_sharing.htm). The user can download these beforehand. 

An example dataset folder has the following structure:
```
